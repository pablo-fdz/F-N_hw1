    "\n",
    "Information extracted from the documentation of the data. Check out as well the [coding guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oaOf9s72FQnzQA8sbE8h0PwMIZLP6p0EDUV2ya065is/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.86aoh6qprspd) of the authors that they use whenever they need to do a judgement call (e.g., calling a demonstration pro-Trump or anti-Trump).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Columns in 2017-2020 (1st edition)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `date`: Date of event in YYYY-MM-DD format. When an event spans multiple days, the start date is used.\n",
    "- `locality`: Name of the locality in which the event took place. Labeled CityTown in the Google Sheets.\n",
    "- `state`: Two-letter U.S. postal abbreviation for the state or U.S. territory in which the event took place. \n",
    "- `location_detail`: Where available, text giving additional details on the location(s) within the city or town where the action took place.\n",
    "- `online`: Binary indicator for online-only events. 1 = online, 0 = in-person. Generated from location and event type information in the source data.\n",
    "- `type`: Type(s) of protest action (e.g. march, protest, demonstration, strike, counter-protest, sit-in), separated with semicolons or commas when more than one. EventType in source data.\n",
    "- `macroevent`: A unique id that associates a counter-protest with the protest event it countered. These strings are composed of a date, a location, and something about the nature of the event, all separated by hyphens (e.g., \"20220624-phoenix-abortion\"). In most cases, these ids will uniquely identify pairs of events. In cases where the counter-protest is itself countered, however—e.g., a community defense action in response to a protest targeting an LGBTQ+ pride festival—the additional events are given the same id, so these clusters will sometimes include three or more events.\n",
    "  - NOTE: This field was created in 2021, and it was only retroactively generated for events associated with the Black Lives Matter protest wave that began in May 2020. So, for CCC Phase 1 data, it is only useful for analysis of that specific subset.\n",
    "- `actors`: The organization(s) that organized the protest event (e.g. Women's March, Greenpeace, etc.), and/or the type of people participating (e.g., students, nurses). Usually separated by semicolons, sometimes by commas.\n",
    "- `claims`: A phrase or phrases describing what the event was about, based on the claims or demands the participants made (e.g. for women's rights, anti-Muslim Ban, against racism, etc.), as summarized by coders. Phrases are separated by semicolons in some records, commas in others.\n",
    "- `valence`: Political valence of the event. Labeled Pro(2)/Anti(1) in the source data.\n",
    "  - 2 = pro-Trump\n",
    "  - 1 = anti-Trump\n",
    "  - 0 = other/neither\n",
    "- `issues`: String of semicolon-separated tags identifying political issues (or themes) associated with the event (e.g., \"democracy; women's rights\" for events associated with the 2017 Women's March). These are generated after data compilation by running a series of regular expressions over the claims description text.\n",
    "- `size_text`: Words or phrases that journalists or eyewitnesses used to describe the size of the crowd at the protest event (e.g., “more than 100”, “dozens”, “about 50”)—or, in cases where no text descriptions were found but other sources gave information about crowd size, the alternative source used: “count pic” for photograph(s), “count vid” for video(s), “count FB” for Facebook, or “eyewitness” for eyewitness.\n",
    "- `size_low`: Lowest crowd size reported in, or estimated from, size_text. To convert vague text counts to numbers, the following three rules are always used for both `size_low` and `size_high` (see below).\n",
    "  1. For phrases with fudge words (e.g., “about”, “nealy” “approximately”, “maybe”), ignore the fudge word and treat the number that follows it as the count.\n",
    "  2. When unspecific multiples are given, assume the multiple is 2  (e.g., “hundreds” becomes 200, “thousands” becomes 2,000).\n",
    "  3. Assume “several” means 3 (e.g., “several dozen” becomes 36, “several thousand” becomes 3,000).\n",
    "- `size_high`: Highest crowd size reported in, or estimated from, size_text. \n",
    "  - When vague text counts are converted to numbers, the high and low estimates are assumed to be equivalent. For example, if the only information available about crowd size is a single report describing it as “hundreds”, 200 would be assigned to both size_low and size_high. \n",
    "  - If, however, one source described the crowd size as “hundreds” and another as “about 500”, then size_low would still be 200, but size_high would be 500.\n",
    "- `size_mean`: The mathematical average of size_low and size_high, rounded up to the nearest integer.\n",
    "- `size_cat`: Ordered categorical indicator of crowd size, representing orders of magnitude and derived from size_mean.\n",
    "  - 0 = unknown\n",
    "  - 1 = 1-99 (tens)\n",
    "  - 2 = 100-999 (hundreds)\n",
    "  - 3 = 1,000-9,999 (thousands)\n",
    "  - 4 = 10,000+ (tens of thousands)\n",
    "- `arrests`: Text, sometimes specifying the count of protesters reportedly arrested (e.g., “5”), sometimes a phrase indicating ambiguity about that count (e.g., \"more than 5\", \"unclear\", “unspecified”).\n",
    "- `arrests_any`: Binary indicator for whether or not any arrests occurred, derived from arrests. 1 = yes, 0 = no.\n",
    "- `injuries_crowd`: Text, sometimes giving a count of protesters reportedly injured (e.g., “5”), sometimes a phrase indicating ambiguity about that count (e.g., \"more than 5\", \"unclear\", “unspecified”).\n",
    "- `injuries_crowd_any`: Binary indicator for whether or not any protesters were reportedly injured, derived from injuries_crowd. 1 = yes, 0 = no.\n",
    "- `injuries_police`: Text, sometimes giving a count of police officers reportedly injured (e.g., “5”), sometimes a phrase indicating ambiguity about that count (e.g., \"more than 5\", \"unclear\", “unspecified”). \n",
    "- `injuries_police_any`: Binary indicator for whether or not any police officers were reportedly injured, derived from injuries_police. 1 = yes, 0 = no.\n",
    "- `property_damage`: Text, usually a binary indicator for whether or not any property damage occurred, sometimes a count or other number of unclear meaning, sometimes something else. \n",
    "- `property_damage_any`: Binary indicator for whether or not protesters reportedly caused any property damage, derived from property_damage. 1 = yes, 0 = no.\n",
    "- `chemical_agents`: Binary indicator for whether or not police or other state security forces used tear gas or other chemical irritants, such as pepper spray or pepper balls, on protesters. Labeled TearGas in the source data, but only available for May–December 2020.\n",
    "- `source_n`: URL of nth source, or description where the source is not a web page (e.g., “eyewitness”, “correspondence”).\n",
    "- `notes`: Miscellaneous additional information about the event as noted by the coder. \n",
    "- `lat`: Latitude of locality in which the event took place, as resolved by Google Maps Geocoding API. Note that this is not based on address or landmark-level information where that is given, only on the name of the city or town.\n",
    "- `lon`: Longitude of locality in which the event took place, as resolved by Google Maps Geocoding API. Note that this is not based on address or landmark-level information where that is given, only on the name of the city or town.\n",
    "- `resolved_locality`: Name of the locality in which the event occurred, as resolved by running the city or town name and state abbreviation through the Google Maps Geocoding API.\n",
    "- `resolved_state`: Postal abbreviation of the state or territory in which the event occurred, as resolved by the Google Maps Geocoding API.\n",
    "- `resolved_county`: Name of the county in which the event occurred, as resolved by running resolved_locality and resolved_state through the Google Maps Geocoding API.\n",
    "- `fips_code`: Five-digit FIPS code for the county (or LA parish or AK borough or independent city or DC or U.S. territory) given in resolved_county. See 'data-compilation/fips_for_county_function.r' for details on how these are generated using the 'tigris' package and some custom code to handle various exceptions.\n",
    "  - NOTE: When you load the data from the stored .csv, you will probably need to add leading zeros back to FIPS codes that have them, because your software will probably read that column as integers instead of strings. In R, you could do this with `ifelse(nchar(fips_code) == 4, paste0(\"0\", fips_code), fips_code)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Columns and modifications in the 2nd edition**:\n",
    "- `title`: Title of action when one is given, usually on a flyer announcing the event.\n",
    "- `organizations`: Semicolon-separated names of organization(s) that participated in the event, including but not limited to organizers and endorsers (.e.g, “Fridays for Future New York; Extinction Rebellion New York; Greenfaith”). \n",
    "- `participants`: Semicolon-separated text descriptors of participants in the event, usually from press reports, sometimes recorded by coders based on photos or video (e.g., “students; faculty; staff; community members”).\n",
    "- `claims`: Comma-separated text phrases describing what the event was about. \n",
    "- `claims_summary`: Text phrase or comma-separated text phrases giving coder’s summary of the action’s main claims or demands. Each phrase should begin with either “for”, “against”, or “in [action word] [of/with/for]” (e.g., “in commemoration of…”, “in solidarity with…”, “in remembrance of…”). Generated programmatically from claims field, so there will be occasional errors of omission and commission due to typos and such.\n",
    "- `claims_verbatim`: Comma-separated verbatim text captures of claims made by event participants on signs, banners, t-shirts, and flags or as chants or shouts. Generated programmatically from claims field, so there will be occasional errors of omission and commission due to typos and such.\n",
    "  - Phrases that end with an exclamation point (e.g., “no justice no peace!”) are chants or shouts.\n",
    "  - Text inside square brackets (e.g., “[wire hanger ]”, “[watermelon]”) is a coder’s description of an image or symbol seen on a sign or banner.\n",
    "  - Flags are recorded as phrases ending in “flag” (e.g., “Confederate flag”, Gadsden flag”). National flags other than the U.S. flag are recorded as the name of the country followed by “flag” (e.g., “Israel flag”, “Mexico flag”). The American flag is usually recorded as “American flag”, sometimes as “U.S. flag”, “US flag”, or “USA flag”.\n",
    "  - When the same claim is seen more than once, only one instance of it is recorded here.\n",
