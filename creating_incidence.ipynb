    "In our dataset, we identify four columns that capture different forms of violence: arrests, injuries among crowd members, injuries involving the police, and property damage. We construct a new binary variable, `violence`, which is equal to 1 if any of these four indicators has a value greater than 0. This variable may offer useful insights, as there could be underlying patterns linking the nature of a protest’s claim to its likelihood of becoming violent. For instance, protests that occur more frequently — often driven by issues perceived as highly relevant or urgent by the population — might be relatively more prone to violence than protests that are rare and centered around less pressing concerns."

    "Since our dataset includes only actual protest events (i.e., there are no explicit zero entries indicating the absence of protests), and given that multiple protests can occur within the same month and state, we adopt an aggregation strategy to construct the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "We focus on four protest categories particularly relevant within the U.S. context: healthcare, racism/immigration, housing, and guns/criminal justice. Each category is identified through a set of representative keywords in the protest's 'issues' field.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process implemented in our code involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Categorization**: For each of the four selected categories, we identify protests containing relevant keywords in their 'issues' field.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Aggregation**: We group the data by state and period (month-year), calculating two key metrics:\n",
    "  - The total count of protests for each category in that state-month\n",
    "  - Whether any of those protests involved violence\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handling of NaNs in the date column**: We had some states for which there were some months with no protests, and this caused the groupby operation by state and period to create NaNs in the `protests_count` column (instead of properly having zeros). By filling the missing dates with zeros (i.e., combination of month and state that did not experience any protest) than we also properly create the `protests_count` column, having in it only zeros or actual counts of protests. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Threshold-based target creation**: Unlike a simple binary indicator, we create a more sophisticated target variable that captures unusual levels of protest activity:\n",
    "  - For each state, we calculate the average number of protests per month for each category over the entire time period and we use it as state-specific threshold\n",
    "  - A state-month is assigned a target of 1 if the number of protests exceeds this threshold\n",
    "  - This approach adjusts for the baseline level of protest activity in each state, making the target more meaningful\n",
    "\n",
    "This dynamic threshold approach offers several advantages:\n",
    "- It accounts for varying baseline protest levels across states (e.g., New York naturally has more protests than Wyoming)\n",
    "- It helps identify unusual spikes in protest activity rather than just the presence of protests\n",
    "- It creates a more balanced target variable, improving the potential predictive power of forecasting models\n",
    "\n",
    "By tracking these unusual protest levels over time and across states, we can identify patterns that might indicate emerging social tensions before they escalate into more widespread unrest."
